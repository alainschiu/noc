...in things that you cannot change, it is like a stone that is tied to one's feet, held you in its place. stringing you further down the abyss of endless stream of thoughts

	Is a veil of air that, a filter in the vision, that cannot go away. [[Backlog of Emotions]] Lost in your own thought, looking out, this air, the people passing by, the clouds that swirl around you (on their own accord,) none of that explains what you are feeling. They are sarcastically mocking you perhaps? Or that they have no interest in what you do, feel, think. 

Finding solace in another person, moment, situation. That sort of speaks to your own [[Loneliness]] 

The feeling comes from when you know no matter how close these person moment and situations are to yours, they are not entirely yours. Your feeling is unique and no one ever will get to know it 100%

Nonetheless, being in the same situation help. And we can stop and marvel at this: 100+ people in the same room, each buried in their own thoughts, each having their private space (see: [[Private Music]]) but somehow we are together. As if it was a ritual, a support group, or just an entirely sad resignation into the truth of us being essentially alone. I can imagine it bittersweet

I want to know if this is universal, do all people feel the same? when they look into the night and realize how isolated they are?  See [[Soren Kierkegaard]]
