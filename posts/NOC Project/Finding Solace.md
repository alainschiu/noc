In things that you cannot change, it is like a stone that is tied to feet , held you in its place. dropping further down the abyss of endless stream of thoughts

			Is a veil of air that, a filter in the vision, that cannot go away. [[Backlog of Emotions]]
			
			In your own thought, looking out the the balcony, this air, the people passing by, the clouds swirls around you, none of that explains what you are feeling. They are sarcastically mocking you perhaps? Or that they have no interest in what you do, feel, think. 


Finding solace in another person, moment, situation. That sort of speaks to your own [[Loneliness]] Comes from when you know no matter how close these things are, they are no entirely yours. Your feeling is unique and no one ever will get to know it 100%

Nonetheless, being in the same situation help. And we can stop and marvel at this: 100+ people in the same room, each buried in their own thoughts, each having their private space [[Private Music]] but somehow we are together. As if it was a ritual, a support group, or just an entirely sad resignation into the truth of us being essentially alone. 

I want to know if this is universal, do all people feel the same? when they look into the night and realize how isolated they are [[Soren Kierkegaard]]
