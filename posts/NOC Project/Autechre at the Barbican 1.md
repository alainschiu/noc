Total darkness

It was my first time at the #barbican and actually first experience at a Warp artist concert
I had no expectation therefore what would this experience be like.

The first set by #ZovietFrance was good i suppose. The sound and texture evolves in the hall and slowly and surely gathers up to be a sonic mess, a trance. But then I was a bit tipsy and tired to avoid myself from falling asleep (and failed miserably at that)

For the main-set, the it all happened in a pitched dark hall. I didn't know one can play electro/ experimental dance music in a glamorous hall pitched dark while everyone is sitting down.

There was no visual element at all other than the occasionally veil of light and shadow. It was minimal to a point that I actually do not remember much about the music but the whole experience is something to behold. 

You feel the vibration and rhythm viscerally, corporeally, physically. Your pupil expand and constrict. You feel time

At times, your mind wanders off to places of your own. (like myself, who was envisioning my own show for the entirety of another's show)
