trance-induction pioneered by Franz Anton Mesmer. 
Neurohypnotism (nervous sleep)

Believes hypnotism proved the existence of a level of reality that transcended the world of the sense. That level was where the true self lay. More himself than in waking state. 

Sulzer: "turns all one's attention to that which goes on in one's soul. forgetting that outer circumstances that surround one"

Trance state thus associated with the state of [[Innigkeit]] (inwardness) so prized by the romantics. 

music as trance-induction -- natural supernaturalism
Natural access to transcendent experience.
