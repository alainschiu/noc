[^1]**New Simplicity** (in German, _Neue Einfachheit_) was a stylistic tendency amongst some of the younger generation of German composers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, reacting against not only the European avant garde of the 1950s and 1960s, but also against the broader tendency toward objectivity found from the beginning of the twentieth century. Alternative terms sometimes used for this movement are "Inclusive Composition", "New Subjectivity" (_Neue Subjektivität_), "New Inwardness" (_Neue Innigkeit_), "New [[Romanticism]]", "New Sensuality", "New Expressivity", "New Classicism", and "New Tonality".
