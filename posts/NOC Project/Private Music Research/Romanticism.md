Study of the nomenclature 


#### Romantism:  
#privatemusic Excerpt[^1]  from #Taruskin: 
Romanticism questions where "truth" lays. 
**Kant**: defined #enlightenment on the notion of truth on the assumption of an indwelling endowment (categorical imperative: the *moral law within*)  -> Truth is deductible through <u>reason</u>, BUT if formulated as "the" truth (Michel #Foucault : The Uniformed Truth) Then it will be unstable and manipulatable. The person with greater power will prevail and hold whats truth or not. 
Through enlightenment we see that this best-intentioned effort can degenerate into intolerance and dogmatism, culminating in the naked exercise of power. i.e. French Revolution // which had billed itself as the triumph over authority had produced the Terror. Or even worse, in the latter half of the century, created #imperialism (forcible imposition of Western institutions on other cultures and societies in the name of reason and altruism "the white man's burden")

Romanticism is an alternative. Truth (not "the" truth) is found in individual consciousness. NOT to reject the notion of truth but the notion of universalism. "Ideal" not one of uniform correct belief but one of sincerity. #Relativism ///  littler prospect of community or social cooperation.

Romantic Individualism turned inward from public life, espousing the pessimistic social and civic passivity exemplified in the deaf and isolated late #Beethoven finds refuge in "estheticism".  
(More on romanticism and the concept of nation[^2])

My note: Taruskin continues to develop the idea of nationalism and romanticism and their correlation. Without objective truth, nationalism strives to "unite" the blood and the soil. Constituting to confrontations of lands and collective thoughts of "common beliefs"  He then separates the I and We from You and Them.  the I - results in private arts. And in this case, [[Private Music]]

Romantic most formidable opponent #Goethe 
#Faust will lose hi soul to the devil #Mephistopheles the latter warns, as soon as he calls out to the passing moment, "Stop, stay awhile, thou art so fair!". That moment, the moment in which #ethos (responsible action) is sacrificed to #pathos (passive experience, surrender to feeling) will be the moment of damnation. That is the moment romanticism celebrates.

[^2]: Excerpt but very fascinating: Romantic estheticism is the source of the still potent belief that art and politics are mutually indifferent if not mutually hostile terrains. Far from politically passive, however, was another strain of romanticism- substitute collective consciousness for individual consciousness as the arbiter of truth claims -- human collectivity - concept of a "nation" A nation, unlike a state, was not necessarily a political entity. It was not primarily defined by dynasties or by territorial boundaries. Rather, a nation was defined a collective consciousness (or culture) comprising of language, customs, religion, and historical experience.
