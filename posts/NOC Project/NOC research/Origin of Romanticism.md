#CPEBach 
### C.P.E. Bach (1714 - 88) 
Fantasia 
progenitor of romantic "piano lyric" Characterstück or Pièce caractéristique)

His disciple: 

### Jan Ladislav Dussek 
( #Dusik 1760-1812)  "the Sufferings of the Queen of France" (1793)

harks back to #JSBach Capriccio on the Departure of His Beloved Brother 
or even futher back to #Kuhnau Biblical Sonatas

Kuhnau said this kind of music was nothing new, he cited Johann Jakob #Froberger Tombeau (1657) or "funeral oration"

Read Taruskin interesting passage comparing Dussek to Tomasek's music 
Whereas Dussek music was descriptive (programmatic) That works against Romantic ideals
Tomasek's did not disclose specific content but rather advertised a general "lyric" expressivity. 



Dussek represented Marie Antoinette's joys and sufferings, Tomasek his own -  and, by implication, ours. 


### Václav Jan Tomášek (1774 - 1850)
#Tomasek 

[^1]associated with #eclogue or pastoral poem
evoke an air of naivety 

(My note: reminds me in general the music of [[Nick Drake]])



Or 

[^1]: Tomasek invokes ancient genres of rhapsody and dithyramb. #Rhapsody comes from Greek rhapsoidos, singer of epic tales and betokens a dramatic recitation. #Dithyramb originally a song or hymn to God Dionysus, meant for Tomasek and later composers a particularly impassioned utterance.
