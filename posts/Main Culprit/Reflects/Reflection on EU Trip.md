##### Conversation on politics, leftism and liberalism 
(MONOS Kassel)
Conversation with Max and Jacq about sexism and racism in the context of "white savior" leftist arts etc #whitesavior #leftist How far is too far? The arguing encircles that there are fundamental biological difference between sexes and race. For instance, a female is not as capable as a male in fulfilling certain physical tasks. 

I argued that technological advances provides tools to eliminate there differences, to ensure a more levelled playfield. For example, robotic arms help lifting heavy objects, etc 
And that goes further than sex and race. it also helps minority, disabled etc to have the ability to fulfil their dreams. Or less poetically, to be able to have a chance to do what they want to do. Essentially, that is what technology does. To liberate a certain class of people from doing things that was thought as undoable before (see: female artists/ disabled athlete/ color segregation/ black lawyers etc)

Technology fights the authority, or the #statusquo

DO we turn a blind eye to the differences in human beings? I think there are two points to note here 
1) the difference is due to societal construction? i.e. race/ class/ $? We tend to fight the norm, the status quo and to find a new way to see things. and 
2) While noticing the difference, it should not be a hurdle to stop a type of people to do things that they are told cannot be done. Everyone is different essentially, so while there are big categories here in our society, chances are many of those are manmade.
3) Why being left? Simple because we don't acknowledge is hurdles made by societal/ political structures. And to follow the rules or whats been done before suffocate creativity and imagination. It is not fun. #postmodernist Also, because the constant discussion/ fight against the machine type of mentality creates new things in the word. It drives technological advancements, create new thinkings, new works, new vision.
