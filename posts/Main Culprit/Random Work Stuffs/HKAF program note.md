A brief note to Fundamental Differences 

Sonification as a creative process is essentially a procedure to turn artifacts/ remnants into new things. The artifact, being the data, while partly neutral, contains multitudes of meanings. They are symbols, have the ability to annotate changes, and signalize social, political, and environmental issues. Through sonification, the role of an artist collides with the role of one a data scientist: they consolidate information, overturn every stone, and reveal their discovery in datasets. The difference lies in that an artist makes no false promise of maintaining neutrality. We cannot be impartial to our surroundings; artists cherish the vastly diversified ways to interpret phenomena instead of succumbing to grand narratives. 

This sonification process involves less of a composer's intervention. Once the data is recorded, composing becomes merely a process of "making things fall in line." A chance meeting of notes and rhythm. I've learned that the world has an interesting way of composing its own music. It is a contrapuntal composer who negates the rule of parallel fifths, makes huge leaps and jumps, and delineates from tonal centers. Ridding part of an artist's role in the creative process is a practice championed by artists in the avant-garde era. It is apparent in the cut-up collages of Hans Arp, the indeterminacy in Cunningham's choreography, or the chaotic words of William Burroughs. The sonification process of Fundamental Differences allows me to shred some sort of my own "composer's ego." 

That is not to say Fundamental Differences is void of human emotion. On the contrary, because of the neutrality of the data (it is more or less numbers in grids,) the intention, location and the purpose of the data collection, becomes the crux of the work. 

The five datasets that were collected by Keith range from the quotidian to the esoteric data of the City. To me, these data belong on different axes and extend in different directions radially, expanding and broadening our understanding of the zeitgeist. Moreover, each dataset constitutes its own musical universe, manifested in each movement's contrasting sonic and textural qualities.  

I am merely an interpreter: each note and sound you hear is directly or indirectly dictated by the collected data, which in turn, creates a multitude of musical situations that contribute to the grand mise-en-scene. And this process allowed me to create a piece that is truthful to the situation and helped explain my lingering emotions.

Sonification as a creative process is essentially a process of turning artifacts/ remnants into new things. Data, whilst partly neutral, contains multitudes of meanings. They are also symbols, annotating changes, overturning stones, and discovering signals that reflect social, political, and environmental issues. The role of an artist collides with the role of one a data scientist: he or she consolidates and reveals their discovery in datasets. The difference lies in that an artist makes no false promise of maintaining neutrality. impartial to our surroundings, the vastly diversified ways to interpret phenomena instead of succumbing to grand narratives. 

The beauty of the process is that this set of tools/ palette of colors, involves less of a composer’s intervention: once a set is established, the notes making becomes merely a process of “making things falling in line.” A chance meeting of notes and rhythm. What I’ve discovered is that the world has an interesting way of composing its own music. It is a contrapuntal composer who negates the rule of parallel fifths, makes huge leaps and jumps, and delineates from tonal centers.  I cherish the opportunity to shred some ego but maintain some sense of integrity. A practice that was championed by artists in the 50s. Resembles of chance collages of Rauschenberg, the indeterminate choreography of Cunningham’s, or I-ching inspired words or Cummings. 

That is not to say the kind of music written this way is void of human emotion; on the contrary, because of the neutrality of the data (it is, more or less, numbers in grids), the purpose of the data collection, whom and where these datasets were collected became a focal point. 
  
I digress; rhetoric aside, the five datasets that were collected by Keith, to me, belong on different axises and extend in different directions radially, expanding the emotional research, They contribute to a better understanding of an unspeakable emotion. One that perhaps we are collectively experiencing. 

Each of the datasets also constitutes its own musical universe, as portrayed in the different tonal universes of each movement. That said, each note and sound were directly or indirectly dictated by the collected data. I am merely an interpreter. 4 datasets contribute to 4 distinct musical universes, which in turn, create a multitude of music that belongs in the same piece, which expands an understanding of an in situ, a lingering emotion, a zeitgeist.**
