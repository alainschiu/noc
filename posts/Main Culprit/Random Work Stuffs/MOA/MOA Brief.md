Finding the why and how these works come to be 



These musically-inspired calligraphies are trans-disciplinary in nature. The meandering of an artist's emotion, memories and internal singing, are transmitted through the speed and pressure of their brushstrokes. With music as the mediator, the transformation from one medium to another (from music to lyrics to calligraphy) creates a window to both sides. It is a bridge between a public, viewer-facing space and a private space, one of the artists' inner sensibilities.

The intimacy and generality, the public and private dichotomy, is displayed first through transparency of the windows: the opaqueness and translucency fluctuates like a willowing curtain between you and the artists' private space. Secondly, fragments of truncated songs are taken directly from the original tunes that inspired the artists. Whilst the essence of the music is preserved, augmentation techniques and resampling making the tunes irrecognizable. When the music begins, but does not seem to progress, as viewers, we create "phantom melodies" that reside within each of our own archive of memories, our own private spaces so to speak. 

Thus through this digression we are at multiple places at the same time: the private chamber of the artists and ours, and the public one.

When the first note begins but does not seem to progress, what is the song that you are humming within?

The intimacy and generality, the public and private dichotomy, is displayed visually through the transparency of the windows: the opaqueness and translucency fluctuate like a willowing curtain between you and the artists' personal space. Sonically, fragments of truncated songs are taken directly from the original tunes that inspired the artists. These fragmented are permeated with hummings recorded by calligraphers and amateur singers. Whilst the essence of the music is preserved, augmentation techniques and resampling make the tunes unrecognizable. The "music" begins but does not seem to progress. To fill the void, we create "phantom melodies" that reside within each of our archives of memories, our own private spaces, so to speak. Thus through this digression, we are at multiple places simultaneously: the private chamber of the artists, ours, and the public one.
