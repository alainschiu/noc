Taruskin: 
The focus on "I" results in private art. The paradox in music lies in that music is implicit in the act of publication or performance[^1]. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"><u>A Public display of privacy</u></mark> Aspiration to middle class, and consumed at private home[^2]. 

In literature, new emphasis on lyric poem. Poem htat vividly expressed or evoked moods and stimulated #reverie. Encouraging psychological **WITHDRAWAL** from the world and contemplation of one's [[Innigkeit]] Music that doesnt require vocal virtuosity, as stimulated by the mass-production of piano and "chamber" instruments. innig were lyric poem equivalent of instrumental music, notably short piano pieces, #songwithoutwords [[Song Without Words]] evoke moods and stimulate [[Reverie]]


Closeness of this form of music and [[Lyric Poem]] literally means a verbal song
Franz Liszt on John Field

	In writing as in playing, Field was intent only on expressing his inner feelings for his own gratification. It would be impossible to imagine a more unabashed indifference to the public than his. He enchanted his public without knowing it or wishing it. His nearly immobile posture, his expressionless face did not attract notice. His glance did not rove.... It was not hard to see that he was his own chief audience. His calm was all but sleepy, and could be neither disturbed nor affected by the thoughts of the impression his playing made on his hearers....Art was for him in itself sufficient reward for any sacrifice....Feild sang for himself alone?


new level of representation comes into play: the artist's representation of himself to his audience. Field's meticulously crafted <u><mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">public impersonation of solitude </mark></u> ...leaves no doubt that a state of "artistic solitude" had come to represent artistic truth. "did sincerity"

Field specialized in [[Nocturne Nomenclature]] a French adaptation of the Italian *notturno* "night piece"

Term not new to music

Continued, he then refers to this kind of art as "marketable": The representation of private lives in published biographies, autobio and diaries etc was a reflection of (and example to) the aspiration of middle-class "self made man" and their families, who were the primary consumers of this new kind of romantic art (read: [[Romanticism]].
