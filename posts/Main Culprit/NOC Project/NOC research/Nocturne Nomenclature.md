French adaptation of the Italian "notturno"
night piece

The term not new: Haydn, Mozart wrote many (see Eine kleine Nachtmusik)
like the similarly named #serenata (evening music) but the difference is that the notturni before evoke more lightheartedness, mainly for evening parties etc 

However, Field music is more inward. Became the very emblem of #solitude 
To quote #Liszt 

		From the very first sounds we are immediately transported to those hours when the soul, released from the day's burdens, retreats into itself and soars aloft to secret regions of star and sky. 

(<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">My note</mark>: This quote reminds me of the words of [[Soren Kierkegaard]])

CPE Bach [[Fantasias]], for tiny-voiced clavichord evoke similar sensitivity: "*to infuse the keyboard with feelings and dreams*" to quote Liszt 

[^1]		and to free nusic from the constraints imposed until then by regular and "official" form. Before him they all had of necessity to be cast as sonatas or rondos or some such. Field, contrariwise, introduced a genre that belonged to none of these exisiting categories, in which feeling and melody reigned supreme, and which moved freely, without the fetters and constraints of any preconceived form.

Taruskin argues this is not entirely true: Beethoven, who was the past master of "official" form, wrote intimate pieces for the piano. He called them [[Bagatelle]]
"trifles" (read: Anything that is of little importance or worth)

#CPEBach meticulously crafted naturalness || simulated spontaneity  
in its heyday was known as #Empfindsamkeit (hyperexpressivity) was a harbinger of the later [[Romanticism]]
