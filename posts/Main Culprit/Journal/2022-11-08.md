### Thought 1 
I am starting to get very fed up with myself. This kind of indiscipline...Tonight has got to be the last night that I have done nothing. 

Reading [[Reflection on Philip Glass]] you would know that perseverance and habit is what makes a good artist. and not nonstop youtube watching for crap that has no use in your life. 

follow the daily schedule [[System]] [[My Daily Routine]]

Perhaps watching too many videos a day can be very harmful. Devise a plan, that YOU only get to watch one video on the topic everyday. No matter how useful that video is. And do jot down what you've learned. 

There are simple too many things/ too little happening these days. Untangle yourself and BE FREE!
