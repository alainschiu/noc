Soundforms 2022 
Amy Chan x Kin Lam
@F Hall Tai Kwun 

Conceptually brilliant. Surrounding the thought of multidisciplinary practice, bi-discplinary in this case. A play on sound and light. Sound and light objects scattered, and created a sonic-lux biotope. Corporeality becomes a part of the performance, but also intervenes this shape and sound. 

I feel like they have created a zoo in this aura, and the two persons becomes a scientist. It is oddly organic despite the coldness in the objects and costumes. 

Thought:

Leaving home is not evasion, it is an act of proactivity finding your new home, to move on
