### Reflection on space and time

Poincare recurring time 

Find greek reference for the sadness of the unknowable

To speculate the concept of infinity, one might need to look back at zen philosophy [[space and time]]


The idea that nothing we know now applies to infinity (all that we can know about the cosmos really incorporates to zero percent of knowledge if the universe is infinity) philosophy helps us to accept that fact. 
It also lets things to happen. We should marvel at the chance meeting/ serendipity of such occurrence. 

We can know about us, and the "universe" we are in. So in this case, science/ curiosity still works. We can still avoid meteor crashing straight in us, how we build relationship etc

But we must accept the fact that we cannot know everything. 

space and time as relative measurement only. Only emergent phenomena
