Yesterday i learned the a hard truth. There is no-one in the world for you except your own heavy heart and the past. 

She just said she couldnt and she left. I was basically left in the cold. 3 years of relationship comes down to two lines of text. It is how cold this world is now. I will not look into the world she lives in and how she is facing this on her side. The moment she decided to block me out, there is no part of me in her world anymore so I should not intrude. 

But what I was really frustrated with, is time and time again, people just left without saying a word. What about the relationships that we have built?
Am I in the wrong? I might be too old now to linger on what could have been and what might have been, but there is a huge cloud of sadness, to know that there is nothing you could do but to feel utterly alone. 

I also will not look painting her a bad picture. There needs no justification or instant gratification, to put her in a bad way, so that this whole thing seems a bit more palatable. It is not palatable and so be it. This immense  feeling of emptiness and loneliness. Seems to be the theme of a life, of my life. 

This is not my first breakup but it seems more real. I have thought I have learned how to love, but it seems otherwise. Also because I am starting to feel my age, Time has past to a point I may not be able to be whoever I was. Things need to be changed.
