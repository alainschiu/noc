About the concept of [[Smalltime]]

Small time refers to tiny changes that happen over time. The crease of a piece of paper, tagged to the wall, grows over <u>smalltime</u> 
The layer of dust, accumulates, thicken over small time. 

Small time evades our gazes, changes happen under our eyelids.
And upon a day we wake up and notice these changes, put us in awe. An "uncanny" sensation. 

Today I notice the crease on the poster grew. 
I notice the white hair on my sideburns, is more apparent day by day.

#### relevance
These days, when i am more or less stationed, stuck in a room. When one is face to face with four walls, you sense the "smalltime" more than ever. Every creases signifies change. 

You are supposed to be in control, but control slips through you hands without you noticing. I am not in grip with things around me, only to be an observant observer. A third person to the things next to me. This is a sense of #vulnerability A sense of out of my control. And this sense lingers, it lingers
